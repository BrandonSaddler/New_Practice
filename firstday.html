    <h1>Computer</h1>
    <p>A <strong>computer</strong> is an electronic device that processes and stores data. It consists of various hardware components and software programs that work together to perform tasks.</p>
    <h2>Hard drive</h2>
    <p><Strong>Hard drive</Strong> is a storage medium used to store data.</p>
    <h3>Hard Disk Drive (HDD)</h3>
    <p>A <strong>Hard Disk Drive (HDD)</strong> is a traditional storage device used in computers. It uses spinning magnetic disks to store data. HDDs are known for their large storage capacity but are slower compared to Solid State Drives (SSDs).</p>
    <h3>Solid State Drive (SSD)</h3>
    <p>A <strong>Solid State Drive (SSD)</strong> is a newer type of storage device that uses flash memory to store data. SSDs are faster, more reliable, and energy-efficient compared to HDDs. They are commonly used in modern computers for improved performance.</p>
    <p>Both HDDs and SSDs are essential components of a computer's storage system, with each having its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
    <h2>RAM</h2>
    <p><strong>RAM</strong> stands for random access memory. It is called “random access” because the technology allows the computer to temporarily store and access data immediately.</p>
    <h3>DDR2</h3>
    <P>Double Data Rate 2 Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory is a double data rate synchronous dynamic random-access memory interface.</P>
    <h3>DDR3</h3>
    <P>Double Data Rate 3 Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory is a type of synchronous dynamic random-access memory with a high bandwidth interface, and has been in use since 2007.</P>
    <h3>DDR4</h3>
    <P>Double data rate fourth generation (DDR4) is a memory standard designed as a better, faster, more reliable replacement for DDR3.</P>
